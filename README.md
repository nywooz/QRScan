## Description
I'm looking for QR Scan web page where it should works perfectly in all mobile browsers and inappbrowser.

## Requirement
1. Get an open-source javascript library that scans QR codes (you can find them on Github)
2. Use the demo code (Reference link: https://qrscanneronline.com/) to create a web page
3. Click a button to start the device camera
4. Have the camera constantly scanning for any QR code
5. When it finds a QR code, stop the camera
6. Display the contents of the QR code on the screen (eg, print text on the web page)
It must work on iPhone and Android mobile browsers, plus normal desktop browsers like Firefox and Chrome (don't worry about IE, which is useless).
